# Introduction to R-packages

Let's start with the why:

- Order in script-chaos
- Reproducible research
- Facilitates collaborations with others
- Matt & Mossa said it was a good idea

# What does it entails?

You have to...

- Adhere to a very specific file structure
- Tolerate start-up friction
- Enjoy the benefits of never having to ...


---

# Get started

- Github
- Create a directory, and name it what you would name the package!
- Create functions in `R/` directory only.
- Create Vignette!

Of course, Vignettes are for the end.

For now, we make *scripts* and those we store in `notebooks/` folder.
